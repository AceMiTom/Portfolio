           <p style="font-family: sans-serif"> My name is Quan Anh Nguyen, originated from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Currently 19-year-old, I am pursuing my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at Arizona State University. Being born in the fast-paced and innovative era, I found myself connected to technologies at an early age.
            <br>
            <br>
            By far, I can speak in three different languages such as Vietnamese, English, and intermediate Japanese. Using these advantages, I managed to make connections with other colleagues and became the Project Manager of an organization within ASU, VINASU.
            <br>
            <br>
            Given the opportunities to be in a bigger "fish tank", I found myself thankful for others around me, thus it is the strive for me continuing march forward. In these next years, I'm looking to grow myself in the professional environment and be adept at my major.
